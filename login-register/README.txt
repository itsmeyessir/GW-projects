    - Start Apache and MySQL modules in XAMPP Control Panel.
    - Open phpMyAdmin and create a new database named `login_register`.

## Purpose
This website project serves as a simple login-register system for our Comfie.AI but because of the time constraints, we made a choice to put this as a future feature. Users can create an account, log in, and log out. The project demonstrates basic PHP web development principles including database interaction, user authentication, form validation, and session management. It can be used as a foundation for more complex web applications requiring user authentication functionalities.
